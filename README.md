# HW10 Arduino
 
I decided to display the seconds on the LED lights in increments of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 seconds. I felt like the numbers were the increments of a second, minute, and hour which I pay attention to most. I used 6 LED lights with no specific color association.

Here is a schematic and drawing of my circuit visualization:
